Utilizing the MVC model and Laravel framework, this application is written in PHP to ensure security, scalability, and high performance.

## MVC Model
The MVC (Model-View-Controller) model separates the application components into three distinct parts:

- **Model:** Manages the data and business logic. Information about songs, playlists, and users is stored and managed in models.
- **View:** Displays the data to the user and handles the user interface. The Blade template engine of Laravel is used to create dynamic web pages.
- **Controller:** Handles user requests, interacts with models, and returns the appropriate views.

## Using Laravel Framework
Laravel is a powerful and flexible PHP framework that provides many useful features:

- **Routing:** Laravel offers a simple yet powerful routing system to manage HTTP requests.
- **Eloquent ORM:** Facilitates easy interaction with the database through models.
- **Blade Template Engine:** Helps in creating dynamic and maintainable web interfaces.
